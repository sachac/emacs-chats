<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
<b>DURATION: 00:44:27</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> This is an Emacs chat. I'm Sacha Chua being
interviewed by Bastien Guerry. Thanks again Bastien, for doing that chat
with me last time. People really liked it and they were surprised to
find that you weren't actually a computer science geek, you're
humanities. Wow. [Laughter]
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> Not sure there is something as a computer
science geek. Maybe it's overrated, somehow. So let's begin the
discussion. How did you meet Emacs first?
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> Well I was in high school and I was trying to
read as many interesting books from the computer section of the library
as I could &#x2013; small library, maybe four shelves or something like that
&#x2013; and one of the books there was <i>UNIX Power Tools</i>. <i>UNIX Power Tools</i>
has a chapter on Emacs that includes&#x2013;was that mentions of Doctor and
other weird things. One chapter in Emacs and you've got to put in things
like Yow and Zippy or whatever. So I thought it was very, very strange
and interesting. So I tried out Emacs and I actually flipped between
Emacs and Vi for a while, but once I started learning Emacs Lisp and
playing around with configuring it&#x2013;that's how I fell in love with
Emacs.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> And did you have friends learning Emacs with
you or were you alone?
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> Not really. Mostly the other people who were
interested in computers were using Vi or they were using something like
Notepad%2B%2B or whatever it was back then. Then in university, a lot of
people used Eclipse, because we started off with Java development &#x2026; So
Emacs has always been one of those things that it's hard to find people
face to face to talk about Emacs with. Most people just look at you
like, “What? How old is that?” [Laughter]
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> So there's this bit of dandyism kind of&#x2026; I've
found that many people using Emacs are kind of proud of using something
different and I myself was not with all the developers so I was not
proud of using something different. This was just something like that.
Do you feel it was something that made you go deeper into Emacs and
Emacs Lisp?
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> Well&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> You have some exotic tool.
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> Early on&#x2013;I think it was in 2002 or 2001&#x2013;I'd
gotten to know &#x2013; actually 2001 or so &#x2013; I'd gotten to know the open
source community, especially in Emacs with Planner Mode and things like
that, so the early experience for me&#x2014;sure, I didn't see a lot of
people in real life who used Emacs, but I was in touch with this
community which was amazing and they used Emacs (of course, because this
was an Emacs user community)&#x2026; So I felt, within that, “Actually, this
is pretty normal.” And so it never was really a, “oh, I'm going to use
something just to be different from other people.” It's more of like,
“Hey, look at all this cool stuff that so many other people have built,
have added to,” and I really like the community part of it.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> And do you still have &#x2013; because it looks like
you are testing many different softwares, very open minded about what
you can use and what you can try &#x2013; do you still spend a lot of time
testing softwares at all, editors especially, or are you stuck?
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> Editors, not so much. It's really difficult
to compete with the things that I've already got set up. Occasionally
&#x2013;for example, I've been trying out Scrivener as a way to organize blog
posts, because people really like this ability to have all these index
cards with stuff on them and you can link them together and compile
stuff. But then as I use it, I think, “Oh, wouldn't it be nice if I
could just hack Emacs into this thing instead,” and then I go off and I
write Emacs Lisp code, and then I'm back in Emacs. So even when I
experiment with new things, it's often with an eye to stealing ideas and
then putting them into my Emacs configuration.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> So I will come back to this question about this
writing, especially because you are really into drawings, too, right? So
I'm curious about how a visual person can be happy within the text
editor. But my first question would be about Planner. So when did it
start and what was the relationship between the Planner and the blogging
activity that you have?
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> [Laughter] Now there's a funny story there.
Okay. So I came across Planner in my search of interesting things that
are Emacs-related and I started using it to keep track of my tasks and
my notes. I was a university student back then so I had a lot of notes
from class, from projects, from things that I was learning about.
Because Planner had export capabilities, I figured, okay, why not? Let's
export my plans, my personal text files and make those static HTML pages
on the internet and so I put that up there as one of those things. It
was my first website. Actually, no, it was my second website. My first
website was something on Geocities, so it didn't really count. Anyway,
so I have this Planner site. Back then I was starting to read about RSS
and this idea of like a weblog. I had become the maintainer of Planner
after I emailed John Wiegley and said, “Hey, this is super awesome. If
you ever need any help tracking down bugs, I volunteer to do the first
pass and then turn it over to you for fixing things.” And then he was
like, “That's all right. You are now the maintainer.” So then I was the
maintainer of Planner and I was looking for interesting things to add
to it. Since RSS was coming out, I figured, let's take the remember
feature in Planner and change it so that you could not only upload it as
a webpage but you could also publish it as a RSS feed. So very technical
people could then subscribe to this website, but hey, it was there.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> Yeah. So I hope somehow&#x2026; Because I hack
together an exporter for Org Mode about RSS feed, so somehow maybe I'm
going to start blogging once this is ready for production mode. Then you
had this activity &#x2013; was it a general blog or was it especially about
Emacs, and then the diversity came later on?
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> In the beginning, it was just really a raw
brain dump of my notes from class, from life, from the time that we
rescued a kitten from our bathroom walls &#x2013; anything that I wanted to
capture in Planner. It was just actually a side effect that I was using
it to also test Planner RSS and publishing. So my blog was really just
my personal planner. It had my to-do list, it had all these other notes
in it and then as I&#x2026; One of those years I shifted to using WordPress
because I got really annoyed with having to hack in commenting support
and all these other little things in Planner. So I shifted to WordPress
and I just wrote some code that went and extracted all of my posts from
Planner and put them into WordPress. So that's how my blog evolved out
of it. It's always been&#x2026; Because it's always been this collection of
text files and notes for whatever I wanted to remember, that's what it
ended up being.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> Okay. So now, what are the main tools that
you're using for Emacs and what are the ones that you want and still
don't have?
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> Org is the main thing that I spend a lot of
time in, because it runs my life, so I've got it set up for my agenda
and many of my notes. I use Evernote for a lot of the web clippings and
other things I want to capture, but in Emacs, Org still helps me see
what my week is going to look like and remember different things. So
there's Org, I do a lot of Rails development. So I've been playing
around with Ruby Mode, but also Rinari and a couple of tools for quickly
jumping from files to another, and of course, magit &#x2013; however you
pronounce that. I use Emacs Lisp a lot so I just open up a scratch
buffer. I haven't quite gotten the hang of either Smart Parens or
Paredit, so that's still in my to-do list.
</p>

<p>
I guess in terms of what else I would like in Emacs, I'd like to get the hang of Org attachments so that I can manage more of my images within it and I'd like&#x2026; I probably
should look into getting the hang of Paredit or Smart Parens or all
these little tools to make Emacs development better. [Laughter]
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> Yeah. I don't use Paredit yet. I know I should
train myself, but there's a small learning curve and then it's very
efficient and powerful, but I don't know. My first impression, my
feeling was that it's a bit rigid. I don't like anything rigid when I
need to start writing and so my question &#x2013; I remember Carson talked
about the fun, about writing Emacs Lisp, somehow I&#x2026; It's even
relaxing. Do you feel like that?
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> Yes. Oh absolutely. It's very tempting to
just keep on hacking away at something, because it is really interesting
to say, “All right. Hey, I've got this idea. How do I get closer to it?
How do I play around with it?” For example, when you're researching
functions to use for this or you're looking at other people's code to
see if you can build on their ideas, because there's so much code out
there, you can get really distracted looking at all the cool things that
are possible.
</p>

<p>
I find it to be pretty relaxing. I'm
comfortable with Edebug and stepping through the code and all of that. I
find it relaxing because it's a way of getting what I want done. And
then because my Emacs configuration file is public and I also
occasionally write blog posts related to the Emacs functionality that
I'm customizing, I get lots of value out of it, too, because I get blog
posts and I get more conversations and ideas.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> Yeah. And somehow I feel like the Emacs is a
nice tool for doing small, cheap prototyping. Are you using it for that?
If you have something in Ruby that you know is big, do you start
prototyping with Emacs with small functions or even for web development
with bigger constraints?
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> For personal use, definitely. I have a lot of
these scripts that start off as Emacs Lisp functions, because I like
being able to use buffers and regular expressions, search forward, and
all these other little things. Sometimes I never end up turning them
into a shell script or something else. I'll use keyboard macros or write
small Emacs functions just to do something. Sometimes if I've got a good
idea and it works out, then I'll go and write it up as an actual script
that other people can use.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> All right. Cool. And so now the big question &#x2013;
can you show us your Emacs screen? I mean, it's going to be a big
revelation.
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> It's not that scary. Hang on a second. Let me
switch to sharing my screen here and then I can conf&#x2013;ooh, funny effect
there&#x2014;can you see my screen?
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> Yeah.
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> Yeah. So it's basically an Org agenda. “Talk
to Bastien Guerry about Emacs” is in progress. I think it'll take an
hour. And that's basically life. As you can see, my Org habits say that
I've actually not been very good at taking my vitamins or telling Org
that I've taken my vitamins. I did that the other time, so that's okay,
too. But that's basically my life. I also use Emacs on quite a few&#x2026; in
another environment as well. I've got a local virtual machine for my
Rails development and that one's got a different Emacs configuration
just for my Rails work. Since my base system is Windows, there are a lot
of all these little conveniences that I got used to in Linux and that
aren't really available because Cygwin isn't quite there or whatever
else and that's why I have&#x2026; sure, my main Org setup, but I also have
development environments and virtual machines.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> All right. I think many people will feel quite
relieved to see your habits, because when I started using habits, I was
so bad because I stopped because it was painful to see all those red
colors. Maybe we should just switch red and green. [Laughter] It'd be
better.
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> I use Org, because I use the variable
scheduling a fair bit, so for example&#x2026; go to [inaudible] weekly. There
are a couple things like strength workouts that I wanted to do every two
or three days so I really like the fact that Org will keep track of that
for you. So Org Habits comes along as a nice bonus, but I don't really
obsess about the red so much.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> So the word “library” makes me wonder &#x2013; you
seem to be reading a lot, so reading blog posts, books, or whatever &#x2013;
do you feel like Emacs is changing the way you read&#x2013;and of course, it's
changing the way you take notes, but do you read the web on Emacs? Do
you read the blog posts on NNTP or Gwene or something like that?
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> I used to. I used to read a lot of NNTP and
also NNTPRSS and Gmane of course will give you an interface for that.
Mostly, because I've come to really like the way that Evernote clips
things and searches through stuff, I use that instead for most of my
notetaking, but I do use Org a lot for taking notes on books because I
like its outline form. I like being able to quickly search through
things and organize things and say I want to schedule this book for
review three months from now. So that's very nice, in terms of using Org
to support my reading and my learning.
</p>

<p>
In addition, I also keep &#x2013; if I can remember where it is. I also keep
these&#x2013;every so often I make this list of things that I would like to
learn. Again, Org is excellent for that, because I can outline things, I
can turn&#x2026; I can use the list's indentation to break things down
further and so on.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> Yeah. And my feeling&#x2026; I'm taking a lot of
notes about books as well with the hope of turning this into a blog
entry at some point or just some web page. I'm doing these from time to
time. What I discovered was that it lowers the barriers that you can
have before publishing. If I use something else, I feel like publishing
is a big step, and when I use Org, it's just a small step so it's easier
to publish stuff I write. Even if I know it's not well-written, I have
less barriers about this. Do you feel like this?
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> I deal with that by not being too worried
about posting things. So my barriers for publishing are pretty low, but
I do post a lot from Emacs as well. Org2blog is super helpful for that.
For example, when I came back from the Emacs trip in &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; Emacs
conference in London, I basically just started writing this &#x2013; let me
turn off truncate-lines again &#x2013; I started writing this long blog post
about what worked well, what didn't work well. It made sense to keep it
in Emacs, because it was there and had all my links and whatever. But
then to publish it, all I had to do was org2blog/wp-post-sub-tree and
it's off to WordPress.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> All right. Cool. And about the visual stuff &#x2013;
because you're doing nice drawing and you fiddled&#x2014;when you mentioned
Evernote and the way you can clip IDs and so on. Do you miss that in
Emacs, which is very linear and which is very textual? Or is it
something that you've&#x2026;?
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> Well, you can actually inline images in
Emacs, and I did install the library so I could actually &#x2013; hang on a
second, let me break out one of these sketchnotes&#x2026; I think I can
actually pull out some of these&#x2026; There's my “How to learn Emacs”. So
you can open images in Emacs, they're just not very good. I wish Emacs
would let me keep track of more of that stuff, and in particular, I
really like Evernote's ability to search within images. I don't think
that's going to make it into Emacs anytime soon, but if it does, that
would be fantastic.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, I find that the
combination of using Evernote from my multimedia notetaking and then
using Org for all those quick capture or outline more structured talks
or blog posts works really well for me. It means I have two places to
look for things&#x2013; several places actually, because lots of places inside
Emacs as well&#x2013;but it works.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> Okay. And so I don't know if you read the Emacs
blog mailing list, but Lars from Gnus fame started a new browser for
Emacs. It's called &#x2013; I don't know how to pronounce it &#x2013; but it's
spelled eww.
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> Oh yes. I've heard about that.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> Yeah? Thanks to this new way to browse web
pages on Emacs, I guess there is a lot of work about rendering images
and changing the size on the fly, which you can already do, right? In
Org Mode, you can decide about the size of the pictures, in-line
pictures, by giving some attributes to the images or globally to the
file, but I guess that there is room for lots of improvement there, and
I hope this new browser will boost this development about images being
able to &#x2013; I don't know &#x2013; even have floating pictures on the top right
of the screen or&#x2026; I don't know.
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> Yeah. Well, because actually a lot of my work
and a lot of the things I focus on is still in text, there's so much to
learn and do in terms of getting Emacs to be even better for that. And
then in terms of the images, well, I'm looking forward to playing around
with maybe using Emacs to help organize a visual vocabulary. I'm using
Evernote for most of it at the moment, but it would be fascinating to
see if I can use Dired perhaps to start putting that together.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> Yeah. So the missing tool that would be
something about this, but searching through pictures and stuff like
that.
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> Yeah. I think that might look more like a
command line tool that someone else is going to write, that does
handwriting recognition (which is tough!), but hey, you know, if I could
dream, that would be an interesting utility to have. In the meantime,
however, I like the fact that text works pretty well. I'm starting to
get the hang of using org-jump to &#x2013; or whatever is C-c C-j is &#x2013; ah,
org-goto is the command to go around my increasingly enormous Org file.
There's just so much that I have yet to learn about Org and Emacs and
all these things.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> So about this Emacs conference, can you tell us
a bit more where it started, what was it, what did you learn, and what's
next for this real life meetings?
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> Yeah. That was interesting and surprisingly
quickly arranged &#x2013; let me dig up my&#x2026; So the Emacs conference was held
in March in London and it was really&#x2026; This one guy said, “Okay. We've
been talking about having an Emacs conference for a while, let's go
ahead and do it.” He found a venue&#x2014;Aleksander Simic, he found a venue.
He got people to volunteer as speakers, everyone flew in or drove over
if they were close by, and it was a completely free conference. So super
thanks to the venue for making it possible. It was a lot of fun,
because&#x2013;80 to 100 Emacs geeks in one room! I'd never been in something
like that. It was incredible just seeing everyone for the first time.
I'd never seen John Wiegley &#x2013; well, I'd talked to him on Skype, but I'd
never seen him before despite all the years of correspondence. And so it
was good to have everyone in one room. At the meeting, people were like,
“All right. Maybe we should have a London Emacs users group meeting,”
and I think someone went and organized one in &#x2013; where is that as well?
There's another one started up somewhere in the U.S. People are really
looking to connect. I would love to see more of these real life
meetings, but also because I don't travel so much, I'd like to see more
virtual meet-ups as well.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> Yeah. Yeah. You're doing a great job at
boosting this. I mean, it's fantastic. The concrete outcome is more
meet-ups between Emacs user groups and local groups and if there are any
code produced out of the conference, or out of this group&#x2026; or maybe
it's too hard to track?
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> Yeah. No one's quite&#x2026; I haven't heard of
any hackathons yet, but that would be super cool. I love helping people
with their Emacs stuff, so I'm always willing to hang out and help
people with their configs or with Emacs Lisp. The main thing that came
out of the conference is all these videos and I drew my notes for them
as well. But really it was all about, “Hey, look at the cool things that
people are working on. I had no idea Emacs could do that and hey,
let's&#x2026; This is a nice community. People are wonderful.”
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> Yeah. What I like is it's a very diverse
community with all these crazy people having passions for something
else, too. I remember there was a discussion about playing piano versus
playing accordion, remember? And the comparison between playing
accordion is better because it's more like touch typing than piano where
it's heavy typing and stuff like that. So it was funny to have this
various passions and discussion about that. It's more easy to speak
about this kind of activities when you're meeting for lunch in an Emacs
informal conference than online where it's bit off-topic on the mailing
list. So the next step, if I understand well, is to have some kind of
Emacs hackathon on a virtual meet-up online somewhere. Would that work?
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> I'd like that. I'd like that very much. In
fact, I would be up for having regular Emacs webinars or whatever where
we can just do a show and tell session, “Hey, look at this cool thing
that I'm doing.” So Emacsrocks is fantastic and I'm delighted to see
even more screencast series coming up, but there are all these people
with fascinating things in their configuration or ideas who might not
have a screen cast or might not have a blog or might not feel
comfortable doing that, but they'll happily talk to a couple of people
about what they're doing with Emacs. So that's one of the things that
I'd love to help make happen.
</p>

<p>
You mentioned the incredible
diversity of Emacs users&#x2026; that's something that I really, really love
as well. You might think, oh Emacs, right? It's like the stereotype of
computer science, geeky, programming and system development&#x2026; But
because people are coming into it for Org or for statistics or for all
these other modules that people have built into Emacs, you really get
such a wide range of people. I can see the&#x2026; Yeah. Go ahead.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> I guess it's also because the Emacs has such a
long history so it helps gather in people from various backgrounds, from
university or for people learning by themselves and so on and so on.
So&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> Yeah. I really like that. I remember when I
was in Japan and I was trying to learn the characters&#x2013;the kanji&#x2014;I had
a flashcard program. Actually, I used the flashcard.el from the Emacs
wiki, because that's where you used to get everything back then. I
modified the flashcard program to show me cute pictures of kittens or
tell me a joke every time I got things right, which is what you can do
when you've got this flashcard program that's very programmable because
it's built into your editor. One of my friends and co-trainees was like,
“Hey, what's that? How are you doing that?” And although he had never
used Emacs before, I set him up with a flashcard setup just so he could
give it a try. So it's all these little bits of functionality that can
help draw people in.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> Okay. So that's cool. I have another question.
It's a bit personal and it's about me &#x2013; my own therapy about not being
the maintainer anymore. So you stepped down as the maintainer of Planner
and Muse, right? Or are you still the maintainer?
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> Yeah. No. I handed them over to &#x2013; I think it
was Michael Olson and Michael handed it over to someone else, I think.
It's actually great, because it's fantastic to see what directions other
people will take stuff. Then also when I was watching Org's meteoric
rise to fame, I was like, “Oh hey, Planner does this really interesting
thing for example with reading dates&#x2013;the relative ‘Oh that's plus two
days from now or it's plus three Fridays from today.'” So I was like,
“Here. This is a really cool idea. You should totally take it.” It's
great seeing other people come up with ideas for something you've
maintained before, and it's also great being able to help with other
projects that are related.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> Yeah. But how did you feel? How did you &#x2013;
because I feel bad. I mean, I miss the calling. I miss the&#x2026; And so I
feel useless. I had something to do&#x2026;.
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> Nothing stops you from continuing to look at
the list and writing patches and exploring code and all of that stuff. I
did find that now that I'm no longer on the hook for anything, I don't
write as much Emacs Lisp for other people. I tend to write Emacs Lisp
for my config and then if other people find those things to be good
ideas, they are certainly welcome to merge them into the code. Sometimes
I'll still hang out on the Emacs Lisp channel, or check out the mailing
lists or StackOverflow or whatever, just to see what kinds of Emacs
questions people have, and if it's something I'm curious about as well,
then I get to write code for it.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> Yeah. That's cool. I do have some bugs to fix
on Org, so it's not as if I have nothing to do, but I was surprised to
have this kind of let down feeling as if I was retiring. But and also
this feeling that&#x2026; There was this new to-do mode on Emacs, I just
discovered. It was there for years and there is this to-do model and
Stephen Bagman, the maintainer just wrote the new version and I can find
the link back again and he just wrote the new version, so I was like,
“hey I want to try something new.”
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> Oh yes, yes.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> So I was really just right&#x2026; feeling away from
Org Mode. So this is it. Exactly. You have it on the screen. I don't
know if it's on the video, too, but&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> Yeah. That would be there, right? I had to go
find it and see what it does, and especilaly what it does differently,
right? So that's what I'm going to take a look at. There's always stuff
that's coming out.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> Yeah. And coming out from the past, because
this one was there even before Org was, so the new ideas and so it's
great.
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> Yeah. One of the things I love about Emacs is
that all these bits of configuration and all these packages give you a
window into the way that somebody else works, right? So they manage
their to-do's this way. When you read the code or you look at the
examples or you look at the mailing list messages, you get a sense of
all these other different ways to work, and then you get ideas. The way
that I've organized my life has changed so much. When I started using
Planner, it was, “Okay. This is great.” I started doing a lot more of
the Stephen Covey quadrants sort of thing because that was baked into
it. Then when I shifted to using Org, it was like, “Okay. I'll use tags
and contexts more. I'll use the weekly agenda or whatever, because it's
so much easier to make that now.” And so the tools that I used shaped
the way that I work, and when I look at the ways that other people work,
I pick up even more ideas, more things to experiment with.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> And this&#x2026; I think it captures the paradox of
Emacs quite well. From the outside, from people who don't know Emacs, it
looks so rigid, and from within Emacs and the flexibility you have with
coding and text and writing at the same time and exchanging with other
people, it opens new possibilities. It's the opposite of rigidity, as
you say. You experiment with new ways of working and so on&#x2026; I guess we
like fiddling, we love fiddling, and fiddling comes with experimenting
something new and discovering what's inside the machine and so on.
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> Yeah. I guess the way that I've seen Emacs&#x2026;
it's really like a conversation, this huge conversation that I'm having
with all these developers and all these contributors &#x2013; both the ones
that are working on it now and the ones that have contributed and posted
stuff in the past &#x2013; and it's&#x2026; we're all trying to figure out
interesting ways of working and changing the tool, changing &#x2013; it's a
platform, really &#x2013; to fit that. So it doesn't feel at all fixed. In
fact, it feels like it's changing so quickly that it's hard to catch up
sometimes and I look at list-packages and I'm like, “Okay&#x2026;” I tried
reading&#x2013;I've actually read through the entire list a couple of times.
Every time I do so I come across all these new things and even when I
was trying to write that book on Emacs, which unfortunately got
procrastinated, because of this very thing I'm about to tell
you&#x2013;because I was writing about stuff that people could work on and
improve, as soon as I posted my draft and people were like, “Oh, that's
a great idea. We should make that part of the main package,” that meant
my draft blog post was then obsolete, but it meant that everything was
better. And to have something with such an established history also have
that kind of flexibility and vitality&#x2026; it's incredible.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> Yeah. Yeah. Especially&#x2026; And so my last
question before talking about this book you may want to talk about. It's
just a small story about Walter Bender&#x2014;do you know, he's the one
behind Sugar?
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> No. What's that?
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> Sugar. It's the name of the platform running on
the One Laptop per Child project.
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> Oh yes.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> And Walter Bender is the guy leading the
developers community all over the world. He told once that his first
idea for this constructivist environment for kids was Emacs. So I was a
bit shocked, because you don't think about putting Emacs in the hands of
six or seven year old child, but the idea &#x2013; I think it's really what
you're talking about. The idea was that in Emacs you have &#x2013; for
example, the documentation's very close to you, the writing is close to
you and the distance between writing and developing is small. So this is
the very spirit of the conversation between you and the machine and you
and your friends around&#x2026; I think that was the core idea behind having
a constructivist environment that drives you to the code and to all the
people around you to build something together. So just wanted to mention
that, because I think it's interesting. So this book &#x2013; what's the story
behind the book?
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> Well, because I&#x2026; So back in
2000-and-something, because I was learning so much and blogging so much
about Emacs, it was like, “Oh, there's probably a book in here.” And so
I sent in a proposal to No Starch Press and they were like, “Oh, that
sounds really cool. We should have a book called Wicked Cool Emacs.”
They have a lot of other books in the series, so there's still stuff to
model it on. I started with the chapters that I wanted to write the most
about, because I really wanted people to try out Emacs for personal
information management.
</p>

<p>
So I wrote about managing your
tasks, and I think I wrote about reading your mail or something of the
sort, too. But when I drafted the three chapters that I really liked the
most, I realized, hey as soon as I posted these scripts that people can
put in their configuration, because they were often good ideas, Org
would then take those ideas, put them in, so you wouldn't have to do all
that configuration. You just set a flag or whatever else and it would do
all of that for you. I was like, “Hm. This book is going to be very
short,” because everything I add something, then the code keeps getting
shorter and shorter, because everything gets replaced by just a setq
whatever whatever whatever. Which is nice, but well&#x2026; If the
alternative had been to not share it and to wait until it was a printed
book&#x2026; and to have it be obsolete two days after it was published&#x2026;
right? It was better that the ideas got out there.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, the end result was I wrote what I wanted to write, which was
basically how to use Emacs to run your life and then it was like, okay I
don't think this is going to work out. So since then, I've basically
just been posting Emacs blog posts whenever I hack around something
interesting in my configuration or whenever I need to answer somebody
else's question. But because I'm experimenting with semi-retirement and
people seem to like this drawing, writing, blogging thing a fair bit,
I'm very curious about the idea of putting together these resources to
help people learn more about Emacs. Whether it's working with the stuff
that's already out there or configuring things or making their own
modules and packages&#x2026; there's so much to learn and if I can help put
together things like that one page guide to learning Emacs or make
something like that for Org and other popular modules or say, “All
right, if you want to learn Emacs Lisp, it's intimidating, but here's a
map for things that you can learn so that you can gradually learn it.”
Right? Because Emacs and Emacs Lisp are so overwhelmingly large. There
are so many possibilities. But if you learn a little bit at a time, that
helps. However if you're new to it, then you don't know which little
parts at a time can be most useful, so I'd love to help put those
resources and guides together.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> Also I've got now two ideas that&#x2026; The first
one is the map of events from this new communities out of Emacs
conferences all over the world, and maybe we can have more online
hackathons about Emacs Lisp. I would love to help about that. And the
other is this nice map about how do you learn Emacs, because there is a
lot of topics &#x2013; how you can go from one topic to another topic, from
just small customization about this module to learning macros and so on,
so on.
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> Right. Right. It's the&#x2026; People often need
to see why this matters. What are they going to get out of it. For
example, if you're reading about keyword macros, if you're reading
through the Emacs info manual &#x2013; which is a great read and I recommend
doing this for everyone, but it can be a bit of a reference, so hard to
get through sometimes&#x2013;anyway, so you're reading through this manual and
you come across keyword macros and so then like, okay let's play around
with this&#x2026; what if people could discover this because they can see it
in action&#x2026; This is where those screencasts come in. Or they can get
the story of where this saves people time, why this matters, and how you
get started with it. First, you start off doing keyword macros. You
start the keyword macro, you type in whatever, you close the macro, you
execute. Then you graduate to using registers, right? You graduate to
using the arithmetic operations, so you're incrementing your registers.
Then you're doing all these cool things. So there's a path that doesn't
scare people.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> Yeah. I like this idea, because we're always
talking just by reflex about Emacs' learning curve, but it's not a
mountain to climb, it's just various paths that you can explore and
that's what we like. And the last idea &#x2013; I think it's fantastic &#x2013; like
you're not making your book out of dead trees, but you are making this
big conversation about Emacs alive and that's even better, I feel like.
It's better than a book and I'm really glad you started all this, and I
hope you'll have many followers doing this. Even small conversations
like we do with friends and starting to have many conferences or
hackathons and maybe some mentoring from people who are more seasoned
Emacs developers or users to have younglings under their wings. That's a
nice idea for the future and I think it might be a nice conclusion for
this chat. I'm really glad we&#x2026; How was it like fifty minutes?
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> Yeah. Forty-five minutes, because&#x2013;sorry
about the mix up about the time, but yes.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> Okay. Okay.
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> Time flies. But I really like talking to
other Emacs geeks about all these cool things we can do with the
community, so I'm up for more conversations like this if people want.
It's been such a fantastic experience. I find it hard to believe that
I've been playing around with Emacs for the past ten years and I still
feel so new and so excited about all of it.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> So maybe one last word about&#x2026; Do you speak
other functional languages other than Emacs Lisp?
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> Well I've played around with some of them,
but Emacs Lisp is actually the main thing that I use. However, what it
has done is Lisp has totally warped my brain, because now when I'm
writing things like Ruby code, because Ruby has maps and all of that as
well, I think in lists. The code that I write has changed because of the
code that I'm reading, the code that I'm working with Emacs. So when I'm
stuck using a language like Java, for example, like&#x2026; Why can't I just
do this thing?
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> Yeah. So it helps learning Lisp and Emacs Lisp
even for other languages?
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> Oh yeah. And also because I use Emacs a lot
when I'm &#x2013; for example, when I'm analyzing data. Sometimes I'll just
yank something into a scratch buffer and then do my keyboard macro
search and replace and all that stuff, maybe write a function that
cleans things up if I'm doing this regularly. Then I'll take that and
I'll use that as an input for something else. It's such a useful general
tool and it's awesome.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> All right. Great. So I think we can stop here.
We have many ideas, and so you gave me energy to work on some of them.
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> Yay!
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> And that's really nice. I think the mailing for
the Emacs conf is always on, because I started with the mailing list.
It's always available so we can discuss for those activities. My
schedule is completely full until December, but I've discussed with some
French people, so hello French developers, we are putting together
something about an Emacs small conference in Paris at some point, and
maybe there is Richard Stallman traveling a lot in France, so maybe we
can catch Richard and have him explain what is the history or maybe the
prehistory of Emacs and stories that nobody's heard so far. I don't
know. That would be cool, too.
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> Yeah. And virtual meet-ups. Again, I'm up for
figuring out what those look like, how those work, just more ways to
connect.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> I'm up for it. Paris is completely rainy for
the last two years, so virtual meet-ups are perfect, sunny and bright.
It's good.
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> All right. Thank you so much, Bastien.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> Thank you, Sacha. Hope to see all the comments
from people, more questions and more ideas about how to move things
forward.
</p>

<p>
<b>Sacha:</b> For sure. All right! Talk to you soon!
</p>

<p>
<b>Bastien:</b> Bye bye.

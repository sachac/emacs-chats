* Introduction

The Emacs community has a lot of amazing people, although we rarely get to meet face to face. It’s great to get a sense of what people are like, so here are some casual chats with other Emacs geeks. =) Want to talk about Emacs? [[http://sachachua.com/contact][I’d love to hear from you!]]
